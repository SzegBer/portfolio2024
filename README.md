### Portfolio page redesign 2024

This project was created in React, using MUI and some CSS animations.

After coming up with the design, I wanted to make the most simple way to display content.
So I chose to use simple js objects to store any content, which then can be used by components.

CSS text reveal animations inspired by [Anthony Fessy](https://codepen.io/antho-fsy/pen/wJqWKj).
